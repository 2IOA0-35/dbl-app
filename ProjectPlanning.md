# Project Description

The webapp is available at [dbl.riswick.net](https://dbl.riswick.net), which gets updated with the latest version on a regular basis.

## Languages

The project will be created using React for the web frontend. For now, a server backend seems unnecessary, and will therefore not be focussed on in the first sprint.

## Visualisations

Our aim is to include the following two visualisations in the webapp:
 - [Hierarchical Edge Bundling](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hierarchical-edge-bundling)
 - [Disjoint Foce-Directed Graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/disjoint-force-directed-graph)

D3 will be used for creating visualisations.

## Structure

The project code will be stored in GitHub. Also, all wishes and tasks are available on a project board inside the repository.
This document includes an exported list of the issues (tasks) and wishes present in GitHub.

## Team Agreements

 - We will have a scrum meeting on Monday 13:30, Wednesday 08:45 and Friday 08:45 in which everyone will try their best to be able to attend and be on time.
 - The scheduled working hours we have chosen are timeslot B and D (monday afternoon, wednesday morning and afternoon and friday morning). It is expected that you try to work mainly in these hours, such that multiple people are online for some interaction like questions or feedback.
 - If you are not able to work during the indicated hours, then that is ok. You are expected to make up the time you lost before the next meeting.
 - If you have any questions, you can always ask them in the Discord where people will be available during the working hours to answer them or work togeter towards a solution.
 - We will work through the task list and assign them each meeting. We will assign based on priority to make sure that all things that need to be finished before the next sprint are finished.
 - We set a clear sprint goal when we plan the sprint such that we know what we need to have accomplished by the end of each sprint.
